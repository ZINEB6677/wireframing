# wireframing
Wireframing is the practice of creating simple, schematic blueprints for digital products like websites and apps, using basic shapes and placeholders to define layout, structure, and functionality. Its primary importance lies in saving significant time and money by identifying usability issues early, serving as a clear communication tool to align teams and stakeholders, and ensuring a user-centered foundation is solid before any visual design or development begins.
